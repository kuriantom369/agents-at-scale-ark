# Teams

Teams are collections of agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks. They coordinate multiple agents using different strategies to process inputs and generate comprehensive outputs.

Teams enable multi-agent collaboration by defining how agents should work together. Different execution strategies allow teams to handle various workflow patterns like sequential processing, parallel execution, or specialized coordination.
## Creating Your First Team

Let's use the Sequential Team defined in `samples/teams/sequential.yaml`. This team contains multiple instances of the same agent working in sequence.

First, we need to apply the team configuration which includes both the agent and team definitions:

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/teams/sequential.yaml
```

Now, let's query the team using the sample query:

```bash
fark query query-seq
```

After all the above steps, we can also query the team directly using fark:

```bash
fark team team-seq "Hello from the team!"
```

## Modifying Teams

You can modify existing teams in several ways:

### Update Team Configuration

```bash
# Change the team strategy
kubectl patch team team-seq --type='merge' -p='{
  "spec": {
    "strategy": "round-robin"
  }
}'

# Add more members to the team
kubectl patch team team-seq --type='json' -p='[{
  "op": "add",
  "path": "/spec/members/-",
  "value": {
    "name": "agent-seq",
    "type": "agent"
  }
}]'
```

### Edit Team Files Directly

```bash
# Edit team configuration interactively
kubectl edit team team-seq

# Or update from a modified file
kubectl apply -f samples/teams/sequential.yaml
```

## Managing Team Resources

### List and Inspect Teams

```bash
# List all teams
kubectl get teams

# Get detailed information about a team
kubectl describe team team-seq

# View the full team configuration
kubectl get team team-seq -o yaml

# Check team status through ARK CLI
ark check status
```

### Verify Team Functionality

```bash
# Test the team after creation or modification
fark team team-seq "Process this request through the team"

# Check recent queries
kubectl get queries

# View query details
kubectl describe query query-seq
```

## Deleting Teams

Remove teams when they're no longer needed:

```bash
# Delete a specific team
kubectl delete team team-seq

# Delete multiple teams
kubectl delete team team-seq research-team analysis-team

# Delete all teams (use with caution!)
kubectl delete teams --all
```
