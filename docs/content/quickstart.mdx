# Getting Started

Get ARK running in your Kubernetes cluster in just a few minutes using our automated quickstart.

## Installing Ark

You can set up a local `.ark.env` file to run the quickstart with all the needed configuration. If this file is missing the quickstart command will ask you for configuration interactively:

```bash
# Optionally create a local config file.
cp .ark.env.local .ark.env

# Clone the repository.
git clone git@github.com:mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark.git
cd agents-at-scale

# Install all dependencies and set-up Ark
make quickstart

# Test your first agent
fark agent sample-agent "Hello! Tell me about yourself."
```

That's it! ARK is now running with a sample agent ready to use.

To run the [ARK Dashboard](/user-guide/dashboard):

```bash
make dashboard
```

You can then open the Dashboard at: http://127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/
